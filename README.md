# Game Play Advance

## Description
A web based GameBoyAdvance emulator for iOS.

Because Game Play Advance is web based, it's easy to get started playing games on your iPhone. No jailbreak required, and no download either!

## Instructions
1. Visit [gameplayadvance.com/gameplayadvance](https://gameplayadvance.com/gameplayadvance) in Mobile Safari on your iPhone or iPad
2. Tap the 'Share' button
3. Choose 'Add to Home Screen'

As of right now, ROMS can only be loaded into the emulator with ROMs that are on your local device.
Simply goto settings -> ROM -> Browse and choose the .gba file you'd like to play.

## Features to be implemented:
* Google Drive storage for ROMS
* Link cable over Web Sockets
